# vDNN
My implementation of the paper titled **vDNN: Virtualized Deep Neural Networks for Scalable, Memory-Efficient Neural Network Design** (https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08124). Supports only linear networks currently.

### Instructions to set up
Run cmake and make both inside vDNN/cnmem/ as well as in vDNN/. Look at vgg_test.cu for an example of specifying and training neural network.
